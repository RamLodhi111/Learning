Why MicroServices??

Challenges of Monolithic Architecture :
Scalability : can not make multiple changes as it affects each other.
Agility : Need to rebuild complete application for each change.
Hybrid Technologies : Need to depend on same technology.
Fault Tolerance: For any small issue, complete aplication will get down.


What is Microservices?
Microservices is an architecture wherein all the components of the system are put into individual components,
which can be built, deployed, and scaled individually.
