Why MicroServices??

Challenges of Monolithic Architecture :

Scalability : can not make multiple changes as it affects each other.
Agility : Need to rebuild complete application for each change.
Hybrid Technologies : Need to depend on same technology.
Fault Tolerance: For any small issue, complete aplication will get down.
